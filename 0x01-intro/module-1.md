# Node.js Basics - Module 1

Welcome to the first step in my **Node.js** journey. In this module, I will get familiar with the basic concepts of **Node.js**, how to install and set it up on my environment, and then build my first script. By the end of this first module, I’ll understand what **Node.js** is, how it works, and why it’s great for building scalable server-side applications.

## What I will learn?

- Understand the definition of **Node.js** and its use cases.
- Set up my environment to run **Node.js** applications.
- Write and execute my first **Node.js** script.
- Comprehend how **Node.js** differs from browser JavaScript.
- Understand the core architecture of Node.js, including the event loop and its single-threaded nature.
