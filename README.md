# Node.js Practice 🚀  

Hey there! 👋  

Welcome to my **Node.js Practice** repo! 🎉  

## What's This About?  
Over the next two weeks, I’ll be diving into Node.js 🛠️—learning the basics, experimenting with features, and trying out cool stuff. It’s all about leveling up my skills one step at a time!  

## What’s Next?  
Once I get the hang of Node.js, I’ll move on to Express.js 🧑‍💻.

Feel free to check out what I’m working on or drop some ideas if you have any! Let’s build! 💡✨
